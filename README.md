# SampleRepository
Sample repository for learning git
This repository is created to practice git commands.
Making changes in develop.
I just created a new feature branch from develop.
Add another line.
Merge this branch with develop. This branch is feature/PR-0101.
Merged PR-0101 in PR-0102 after resolving merge conflicts.
Merged both PR-0101 and PR-0102 in develop after resolving all merge conflicts. Now develop is ahead of 1 commit from PR-0101 and PR-0102 branches.
Now trying no fast forward merge.
